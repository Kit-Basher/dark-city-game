                <p>You do everything for them, but you keep track. Bait the trap and wait like the patient spider. They'll never realize just how much they depend on you until it's too late, they have no idea what you can do.</p>

                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your stress and consequence caps. You've spent too long worrying about what they want. Call in every debt, and make sure they all remember exactly how little they'd have without you. Escape your Darkest Self when you get called out by someone who owes you a lot less than you owe them.</p>
