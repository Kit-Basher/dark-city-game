                <h2>🩸 Playing an Unsated</h2>
                <p>That hunger is always with you, like a hum in your ears that swells and crescendos until you can't hear anything else. Unattended, it will come to dominate you - but feeding it may be just as bad. Moderation, that's the key! But can you control yourself?</p>
                
                <p>As an Unsated being, you exist in a state of perpetual need. Whether you crave blood, life force, or emotional energy, this hunger defines your existence. You walk a constant tightrope between satisfying your needs and maintaining your humanity, between the predator you are and the person you wish to be.</p>

                <h3>🌑 Darkest Self</h3>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Your dull hunger sharpens. You can't focus on anything else but feeding. Everyone is your pawn, your plaything. You hurt them and make them vulnerable, for sport -- like a cat does with a mouse. You escape your Darkest Self when you're put in your rightful place, by someone more powerful than you.</p>

                <div class="move-card">
                    <h4>The Feeding</h4>
                    <p>-x- You survive off the life force of other beings. You must periodically refill your reserves by either drinking blood, drawing psionic energy or some other method. If you feed off a PC for too long, you can heal a consequence but will cause them a suitable minor injury or negative mental Aspect.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="move-card">
                    <h4>Marked For The Hunt</h4>
                    <p>-x- Feeding multiple times on one victim establishes a preternatural bond. From that point forward, you can meditate on them. Roll Will or Rapport. 10+ you can tell everything about their situation, their location, their health and state of mind. 7-9 you get a general sense of their safety only.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="move-card">
                    <h4>Hypnotic</h4>
                    <p>You can hypnotize people when they stare into your eyes. Roll with Rapport or Will. (Against a PC is Mental conflict) 10+ you can command them to do simple things, You can only get them to do things they might actually do, just don't because of better judgment. 7-9, there's also a negative side effect. Choose one: -they stay conscious and remember what's happened, -they mess up your commands, -they believe the directions come from a supernatural source.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="move-card">
                    <h4>The Long Game</h4>
                    <p>Time matters little when you're already dead. Once a scene, if you refuse a perfect opportunity for you to accomplish your goal in favor of creating a more optimal situation, gain one Fate Point.</p>

                    <h3>🧛 The Vampire</h3>
                    <p><strong>Playing a Vampire:</strong> Some vampires revel in that fact, their afterlife a tapestry of hedonism and exsanguination. Others hate the evil in their skin, solemnly vowing to a chaste and lonely existence. Either way, someone suffers. Where will you draw the line and how will you survive?</p>
                    
                    <h4>Moves only for Vampires:</h4>

                        <h4>My End</h4>
                        <p>-x- You remember every gory detail of your death. When you talk about it in detail, give listeners the adjective 'morbid sympathy'. You get +4 on rolls towards convincing people with the 'morbid sympathy' aspect to be willing participants to your wishes.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">

                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Inescapable</h4>
                        <p>You may offer one of your Fate Points to entice characters to remain in your presence. Once per scene, if they still walk out on you, gain a Fate point.</p>

                    <h3>💀 The Ghoul</h3>
                    <p><strong>Playing a Ghoul:</strong> You're caught between worlds, neither fully living nor completely dead. You feed on the dead and dying, a scavenger of souls and flesh. Your existence is one of constant hunger and the knowledge that you're an abomination to both the living and the truly dead.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Moves only for Ghouls:</h4>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>The Hunger</h4>
                        <p>-x- You have a Hunger that grows over time (pick 1): fear, power, plunder, adrenaline. When you gorge yourself to satiate a Hunger, choose one: - heal 1 minor injury or 1 negative mental Aspect - gain a suitable positive temporary Aspect - add 2 to your next roll.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>No Rest For The Wicked</h4>
                        <p>-x- When you die, wait it out. A few hours later, you wake up with all the injuries and damage still there, but them becoming non-lethal.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>My Crypt</h4>
                        <p>Your home sits upon a winding catacomb, long halls filled with rooms containing the resting bones of your ancestors. You can travel to and from distant locations with very little travel time.</p>

                    <h3>💋 The Succubus / Incubus</h3>
                    <p><strong>Playing a Succubus or Incubus:</strong> You are beauty incarnate. You are the darkness that everyone wants to taste, but no one dares understand. It's there in your eyes, your carefully chosen words, and your every gesture: you no longer have a soul.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Moves only for Succubi and Incubi:</h4>

                        <p>-x- Your body contains many histories, and it desires many things. The emotions generated by the 7 deadly sins are your sustenance. When you recklessly pursue your target, add 2 to rolls. When you ignore a promising opportunity to fulfill that urge, roll Will to resist.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Think Again</h4>
                        <p>Gain a fate point the first time in a scene you convince someone that what they believed is, in fact, wrong and false.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Thrall</h4>
                        <p>After spending a few full minutes staring into your eyes, most mortals will happily go with almost anything you have to say, as long as they can reason it in their own minds. After their adrenaline wears off, as soon as they come to harm or think "this is insane!" They will snap out of it and remember everything.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
