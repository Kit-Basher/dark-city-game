                <h2>👤 Playing a Mortal</h2>
                <p>Who are you? You are nobody. All you've ever wanted was a normal life with a little excitement, then monsters start showing up and turn your world on its head. Like, how is any of this happening? Well you gotta do what you gotta do and some things aren't better left unsaid. Time to figure out how to get what you want in life and learn what the supernatural actually is.</p>
                
                <p>As a Mortal, you represent humanity in a world that has moved beyond the ordinary. You have no supernatural powers, no ancient lineage, no magical gifts - just your wits, your resilience, and your very human heart. This makes you uniquely vulnerable, but also uniquely relatable in a world of monsters and magic. You see the supernatural world through mortal eyes, bringing perspective and grounding that others have lost. Whether you're drawn into this world by love, proximity, or the ability to see what others can't, you navigate dangerous waters with only your humanity as your shield.</p>

                <h3>🌑 Darkest Self</h3>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your Darkest Self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Nobody understands you. Nobody even tries. You do so much for the people you love, and they walk all over you. Enough is enough! Betray them. Show them what it's like to be uncared for. Reveal their monstrosity and yours. Only seeing the pain that you're causing your loved ones will let you escape your Darkest Self.</p>

Using your most sympathetic wellspring of emotion, and gaining +4 on your first Rapport roll in a conversation, you have an uncanny ability to make others at ease with you, especially the supernatural ones.</p>
