                <h2>Playing a Mad</h2>
                <p>You can't be the person your friends and family want you to be, need you to be. You have your own situation to handle, can't they see how hard you have to work at everything? It doesn't matter what they say, you know the truth and you'll prove them all wrong.</p>

                <h2>Darkest Self</h2>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Nobody loves you. Nobody ever will. It's all pain and loneliness and watching other people from the outside, and it will never change. There's nothing left for you here but revenge, so burn it all down. To escape your Darkest Self, you must be confronted by someone who has never hurt or betrayed you, or be shown an act of overwhelming kindness.</p>

                    <p>When you are your normal self, your fear of your repressed self causes you to be constantly nervous. Anytime your emotions overwhelm you, you must roll Will to keep control. You can also lean into it, refusing to roll, and get a +1 on your rolls until the end of the scene or you regain control again, whichever happens first. Should you fail this roll, you will instantly lose control without benefits.</p>
