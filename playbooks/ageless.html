                <h2>🕰️ Playing an Ageless</h2>
                <p>You've seen generations pass, seen eras come and go. You really have been around and really got a chance to witness the human animal in its home environment, they sure are interesting, I wonder what good they are? Eventually they all go away and new ones take their place.</p>
                
                <p>As an Ageless being, you carry the weight of centuries, the wisdom of ages, and the burden of watching everything you care about fade away while you remain eternal. Your perspective on time, relationships, and mortality is fundamentally different from mortal beings.</p>

                <h3>🌑 Darkest Self</h3>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. The world is slipping through your fingers too quickly. You need to cling to something beautiful and as permanent as you. Harden your heart against fleeting things. Prove to the world and yourself that you never needed them; let them burn. Seize control of what matters and make sure it never leaves you. Escape your Darkest Self when you've condemned someone to a lasting fate they didn't deserve, or when you brush against your own mortality.</p>
