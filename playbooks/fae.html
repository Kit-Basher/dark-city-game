                <h2>🌸 Playing Fae</h2>
                <p>At the edges of this world, just beyond the veil, there are colors that few mortals even dream of. Beauty enough to shatter any heart. The Fae live and breathe at the edges of this world. They keep a dusting of that magic tucked behind their ears, just in case. And the Fae are willing to share. They're nothing if not generous, asking for only one thing in return. A promise. Keep it, and the true beauty of the world will be revealed. Break it, and feel the wrath of faery vengeance.</p>
                
                <p>As one of the Fae, you exist between worlds - the mortal realm and the magical Otherworld. You carry ancient magic within you, the power of nature and illusion, of promises and consequences. Your perspective spans centuries, and you remember when magic was common and humans were merely interesting distractions.</p>

                <h3>🌑 Darkest Self</h3>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you are out of stress and consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Everything you say seems to be a promise. Everything you hear seems like a promise. If a promise is broken, justice must be wrought in trickery or blood. You aren't subject to the human rules of mercy. To escape your Darkest Self, you must in some way re-balance the scales of justice.</p>

                    <h3>🧚 The Fairy</h3>
                    <p><strong>Playing a Fairy:</strong> As a Fairy, you live in a world of knights and courts with royalty and princes each owed their own level of respect. You speak carefully as, being nearly ageless, you remember the full consequences of one wrong word. The Fairy kingdoms are through half real scenery, a lake, a big tree but inside are like palaces made from pure magic. You have an opinion of yourself that is in line with your rank in fairie society, and tend to dress and act accordingly.</p>

                        <p>-x- When you draw upon your most feral manner, you take on animalistic mannerisms, echoing the lithe movements of a cat or the voracity of a wolf, add +1 to any physical rolls for the rest of the scene.</p>

                    <h3>🌳 The Dryad</h3>
                    <p><strong>Playing a Dryad:</strong> You are bound to the natural world, your life force connected to plants and trees. You feel the pain of the earth and the joy of growing things. In the Dark City, you're a fish out of water, but you bring the ancient wisdom of nature to the concrete jungle.</p>

In the city, you bring chaos and joy, reminding others of the wildness they've tried to suppress.</p>
