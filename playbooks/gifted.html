                <h2>🎨 Playing a Gifted</h2>
                <p>You're special. Everyone around you always knew but they never expected just how far you would go. You're the best, there is no point wasting time debating, everyone knows. Why don't they grovel?</p>
                
                <p>As a Gifted individual, you possess talents and abilities that transcend the ordinary. Whether through artistic genius, captivating performance, or revolutionary invention, you operate on a level that others can only admire from afar. This exceptionalism comes at a cost - the pressure to constantly create, innovate, and inspire can be overwhelming, and the gap between your vision and others' understanding can be isolating. You are driven by an insatiable need to express your unique gifts, even when the world isn't ready for them.</p>

                <h3>🌑 Darkest Self</h3>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. They don't appreciate what you do, who you are, anything. They're too stupid to know what's good for them. You'll guide them to the truth. You'll undermine their sanity, gaslight them, reach into their minds and break them and you'll use it all as fuel for your next big piece. You escape your Darkest Self when you see the irreparable damage you've caused and see someone you love suffer because of your actions.</p>
