                <h2>🌀 Playing a Mad</h2>
                <p>You can't be the person your friends and family want you to be, need you to be. You have your own situation to handle, can't they see how hard you have to work at everything? It doesn't matter what they say, you know the truth and you'll prove them all wrong.</p>
                
                <p>As a Mad character, you struggle with the duality of your nature - the conflict between who you appear to be and who you truly are inside. Whether you're dealing with multiple personalities, a dark alter ego, or uncontrollable elemental powers, you live with the constant threat of losing control. Your madness isn't just a weakness; it's also a source of power and insight that others lack. You see the world differently, understand truths that others miss, and possess abilities that stem from your fractured psyche. The challenge is learning to navigate a world that fears what it doesn't understand while trying to hold yourself together - or deciding whether it's even worth trying.</p>

                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your Darkest Self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Nobody loves you. Nobody ever will. It's all pain and loneliness and watching other people from the outside, and it will never change. There's nothing left for you here but revenge, so burn it all down. To escape your Darkest Self, you must be confronted by someone who has never hurt or betrayed you, or be shown an act of overwhelming kindness.</p>

                    <h3>Dysphoria/Euphoria</h3>
                    <p><strong>-x- When you are your normal self,</strong> your fear of your repressed self causes you to be constantly nervous. Anytime your emotions overwhelm you, you must roll Will to keep control. You can also lean into it, refusing to roll, and get a +1 on your rolls until the end of the scene or you regain control again, whichever happens first. Should you fail this roll, you will instantly lose control without benefits.</p>

                    <p>When you are your other self, your bestial nature can cause some to fear you and others to fall for you. While not your normal self you gain a +2 on all Rapport rolls and Provoke rolls but an automatic total of 6 on Will rolls.</p>

                    <p>You keep a list of the things that push you most. Once per scene, expressing it helps calm you, and whenever you do, you gain some insight into that thing. Take +2 on your first roll when facing that challenge.</p>
