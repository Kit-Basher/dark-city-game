                <h2>🔮 Playing a Mage</h2>
                <p>The energy is all around us, why can't they feel it? You can, it's part of who you are and you can use it, really it's too bad for those who can't, they don't know what real power looks like. They couldn't handle it if they did. Control the power, bend it to your will and make the world as you like.</p>
                
                <p>As a Mage, you walk between the mundane and the mystical, wielding forces that others can only dimly perceive. Magic flows through you like blood through veins, a constant presence that shapes your perception of reality. Whether you channel this power through ancient knowledge, natural intuition, or dark bargains, you understand that the world is far more complex and malleable than most people realize. This gift comes with responsibility and temptation - the same energy that can heal and protect can also destroy and corrupt.</p>

                <h3>🌑 Darkest Self</h3>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your Darkest Self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. The time for subtlety and patience is over. You're too powerful to put up with their garbage any longer. Do whatever you need to do to get everything you want to have, so that life can be good again, like it used to be. You are no longer your darkest self when someone forces you to stop for a second and deal with your shit.</p>

                <p>The energy is all around us, why can't they feel it? You can, it's part of who you are and you can use it, really it's too bad for those who can't, they don't know what real power looks like. They couldn't handle it if they did. Control the power, bend it to your will and make the world as you like.</p>
                
                <p>As a Mage, you perceive the fundamental forces that others take for granted. Magic flows through you like blood through veins, and you've learned to harness this power to reshape reality itself. Whether through years of study, natural talent, or dark bargains, you command abilities that defy explanation and break the laws of nature.</p>

                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your Darkest Self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. The time for subtlety and patience is over. You're too powerful to put up with their garbage any longer. Do whatever you need to do to get everything you want to have, so that life can be good again, like it used to be. You are no longer your darkest self when someone forces you to stop for a second and deal with your shit.</p>

                    <p><strong>Playing a Witch:</strong> A good witch turns a blind eye to ideas of sweet vengeance and control. A good witch is above that sort of thing. At least, most of the time. You have a hidden "Book of Shadows" that you record all your most important spells and ceremonies, maybe something fun.</p>

                        <p>-x- Max once daily you can spend 5 FP to imbue a doll made of small bones and something personal from your target like a bit of hair, with a hex. When you place the doll in an unpleasant situation and cast a spell the target of your spell gains a simple negative aspect that reflects the situation the doll is in. ie the doll is in a hot place, they get "sweating", (max 1 aspect per person at a time).</p>

                        <p>Circle and candle magic can be used for all kinds of protection and prosperity spells, take the time to perform the whole ritual and it provides the target with a one time +1 to a failed roll, potentially changing it into a success (added after the roll) (not stackable).</p>

                        <p>You can imbue crystals with magical energy to promote skill improvement. Specify who the stone is for, focus your energy into it. While the target is carrying the crystal, it will provide them with +1 to a skill of their choosing but -1 to another. Only skills at +1 or higher can be decreased by this. (not stackable)</p>

Roll Lore: 10+ the character you did the reading for gets +2 to any Will rolls to pursue that outcome and -2 to Will rolls against it. 7-9 the character gets +1 to Will rolls to that end and -1 against.</p>
