                <p>At the edges of this world, just beyond the veil, there are colors that few mortals even dream of. Beauty enough to shatter any heart. The Fae live and breathe at the edges of this world. They keep a dusting of that magic tucked behind their ears, just in case.</p>
                
                <p>And the Fae are willing to share. They're nothing if not generous, asking for only one thing in return. A promise. Keep it, and the true beauty of the world will be revealed. Break it, and feel the wrath of faery vengeance.</p>

Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Everything you say seems to be a promise. Everything you hear seems like a promise. If a promise is broken, justice must be wrought in trickery or blood. You aren't subject to the human rules of mercy. To escape your Darkest Self, you must in some way re-balance the scales of justice.</p>

You speak carefully as, being nearly ageless, you remember the full consequences of one wrong word.

You have an opinion of yourself that is in line with your rank in fairie society, and tend to dress and act accordingly.</p>

They sport many subtle colors of skin tones and are one with the forest and its inhabitants. Humans are just the latest fad in Mother Earth's game, though they do seem awfully destructive. You feel the forest's pain and the plants tell you their stories. You get where you need to be and know how to stay out when it's not your problem.</p>

                    <p>There is a martial art that you love and you've watched every movie ever about it so that makes you a legend at it, of course. What are you amazing at? Dance? Swordplay? Pistols? Karate? Maybe some exotic weapon? You can choose to roll Athletics instead of Physique for defensive rolls.</p>

                    <p>Your shadow is sentient and has its own opinions. While it can't talk it can usually get its point across to you. Your shadow can leave your presence to sneak through door cracks or look through high windows.</p>

                    <p>As a Pan you are a never aging child of wonder, you reign over your own pocket dimension created by your dreams. Though you cannot directly influence them, these lands slowly change depending on your dreams, coming up with new exciting things to do. Flying, dancing, acrobatics, climbing, whatever it is, you always excel but you won't ever stop to look at it from another's "perspective".</p>
