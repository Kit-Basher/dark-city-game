                <h2>Playing a Giant</h2>
                <p>You're big, so what? Why does everyone have to remark about it like you had no idea? Why when someone needs protecting or beaten up they ask you like it's what you do, like it's who you are. You're more than a big idiot, it's time to take care of your own problems.</p>

                <h2>Darkest Self</h2>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. You're nothing but a violent animal, and everybody knows it. They all just use you - the assholes who think you're just a dumb beast, the suckups who pretend to like you so you won't end them. So fine, be a violent animal. You come out of your Darkest Self when you break something precious that can't be fixed.</p>
