                <p>As an Aquatic being, you carry the wisdom and mysteries of the deep waters within you. The surface world is strange and fascinating to you, with its dry lands and strange customs.

Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Everything sucks and you'll never change it, so just stop trying. Grab the person you care about the most and retreat to a safe place. Defend your little nest against all intruders and ignore everything else - it's not like you were making a difference anyway. You can only return from your Darkest Self when someone shows you that you've changed things for the better.</p>

Being basically a blob makes it hard to get around in society but at least in human shape it's a little better, however figuring out why they act the way they do and how to act like that too will take work. They are so weird and unpredictable, possibly dangerous, running the planet… it was all so much more simple at the bottom of the ocean. No one will take that from me! I'll fight!</p>
