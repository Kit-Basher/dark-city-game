                <h2>🐺 Playing a Wild</h2>
                <p>It's your power and responsibility, keep the beast happy, protect the people from the beast. Some days it hardly seems worth it, but then there are the times of freedom and the hunt and you don't want to quit.</p>
                
                <p>As a Wild being, you carry the duality of civilization and instinct within you. You walk the line between human restraint and animal freedom, struggling to balance your primal urges with your social responsibilities. The beast within you is both a source of incredible power and a constant threat to those around you.</p>

                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. You crave power and dominance, and those are earned through bloodshed. If anyone attempts to stand in your way, they must be brought down, made to bleed. You escape your Darkest Self when you wound someone you really care about or the sun rises, whichever happens first.</p>
