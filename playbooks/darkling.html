                <h2>🌑 Playing a Darkling</h2>
                <p>Why me? The questions rang through your head over and over. How did you draw the attention of a shadow or demon, whatever it is? How do I get it to leave me alone, and do I really even want it to?</p>
                
                <p>As a Darkling, you are touched by darkness - whether by choice, circumstance, or cruel fate. Something beyond mortal comprehension has marked you as its own, granting you powers that come at a terrible price. You walk the line between humanity and something else entirely, forever changed by your connection to the shadows that cling to you like a second skin.</p>

                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. That was a close one; too close. It could be anything or anyone coming to get to you, so trust no-one but yourself. Push others aside, avoid contact and turn away any help you are offered: if they persist, get violent. You escape your Darkest Self when someone forces their help or support on you without hurting you.</p>
