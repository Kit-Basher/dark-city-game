                <p>You have been chosen by fate, by the universe for some purpose bigger than yourself. You don't understand how you fit into the story, only that at some point you will play a major role in it.</p>

                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. None of your friends can help. Any challenges or dangers that you encounter must be faced head on, even if they might kill you. You escape your Darkest Self when someone who didn't believe you changes their mind and comes to your rescue.</p>

                    <p>You can sense when someone you're close to is overly scared or angry. By leaving before they even know there's trouble, you can show up instantly to protect them without being called or needing travel time.</p>

On a 7-9, choose one: your enemy gains the Aspect 'secret weakness'. you learn of an interesting connection to your enemy. add 2 to your next roll against that enemy.</p>
