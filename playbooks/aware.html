                <p>You've seen more than most will ever see and you wish you didn't. There is so much more danger, wonder, confusion than regular people could ever understand. You see it tho, you see it.</p>

                <h2>Darkest Self</h2>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Everyone is lying to you, all the time. If they will not accept your help, you must force it on them, expose the truth. There is no hope, no judgment, no reward, only oblivion to come. You escape your Darkest Self when you learn something shocking that you can't explain at all, or when someone reveals something to you that they'd prefer to keep secret, of their own free will.</p>
