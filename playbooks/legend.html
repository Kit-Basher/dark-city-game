                    <p>Beautiful, mischievous, and sometimes cruel. The Kitsune makes more enemies than friends. The biggest fault to the Kitsune is their lack of sympathy, they often are harsh and treat their Beholden as a slave or pet.</p>

                    <p>Add this to your Darkest Self: Your love of the Pearl grows to near insane obsession, no one can come between you and it, or your Kitsune. Without the Pearl you cannot leave your Darkest Self.</p>

                        <li>Spend a Fate point to help your Kitsune's roll</li>
