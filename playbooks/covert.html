                <h2>Playing a Covert</h2>
                <p>You have always been apart, separate, watching from the shadows, but that may not be enough. How will you go about trying to fit into normal human society when your old life was so alien to them?</p>

                <h2>Darkest Self</h2>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Your Darkest Self is a naked black skinned constantly morphing form fueled on the terror of others. You lash out at everyone who is in your path but especially those who are Haunted. You escape your Darkest Self when someone foolishly opposes you, despite being terrified - or you are treated like a person.</p>

                    <p>You may choose to start a scene invisible. You can also become invisible during a scene by rolling to Run Away. If you disappear or reappear all characters who witness it gain the adjective 'Haunted'.</p>
