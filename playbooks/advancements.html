                <p><strong>Character advancements</strong> are special moves that any character can take when they level up, regardless of their original playbook. These are balanced versions of playbook-exclusive moves that have been adapted for general use.</p>

                    <li>These moves work alongside your existing playbook moves</li>
                    <li>Some advancement moves have special requirements or conditions</li>
                    <li>Advancement moves allow characters to diversify beyond their original playbook</li>
