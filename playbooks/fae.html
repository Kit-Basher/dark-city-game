                <h2>🌸 Playing Fae</h2>
                <p>At the edges of this world, just beyond the veil, there are colors that few mortals even dream of. Beauty enough to shatter any heart. The Fae live and breathe at the edges of this world. They keep a dusting of that magic tucked behind their ears, just in case. And the Fae are willing to share. They're nothing if not generous, asking for only one thing in return. A promise. Keep it, and the true beauty of the world will be revealed. Break it, and feel the wrath of faery vengeance.</p>
                
                <p>As one of the Fae, you exist between worlds - the mortal realm and the magical Otherworld. You carry ancient magic within you, the power of nature and illusion, of promises and consequences. Your perspective spans centuries, and you remember when magic was common and humans were merely interesting distractions.</p>

                <h3>🌑 Darkest Self</h3>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you are out of stress and consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Everything you say seems to be a promise. Everything you hear seems like a promise. If a promise is broken, justice must be wrought in trickery or blood. You aren't subject to the human rules of mercy. To escape your Darkest Self, you must in some way re-balance the scales of justice.</p>

If someone breaks a promise or contract made to you, you can spend 1 fate point to cause them to take an automatic total of 6 on a roll when in your presence.</p>

                    <h3>🧚 The Fairy</h3>
                    <p><strong>Playing a Fairy:</strong> As a Fairy, you live in a world of knights and courts with royalty and princes each owed their own level of respect. You speak carefully as, being nearly ageless, you remember the full consequences of one wrong word. The Fairy kingdoms are through half real scenery, a lake, a big tree but inside are like palaces made from pure magic. You have an opinion of yourself that is in line with your rank in fairie society, and tend to dress and act accordingly.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Moves only for Fairies:</h4>

                        <p>-x- When you draw upon your most feral manner, you take on animalistic mannerisms, echoing the lithe movements of a cat or the voracity of a wolf, add +1 to any physical rolls for the rest of the scene.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>If you spend a Fate Point with someone willing, you can bring them across the veil, into the fairy realm. The spell lasts only a short time, before you're both returned to the mundane world.</p>

                        <p>You don't 'lie' per say, but telling incomplete truths can be just as deceptive. The first time in a scene that you can convince people of a lie by telling half-truths and manipulate them in your favor, receive a Fate Point.</p>

                    <p><strong>Playing a Dryad:</strong> Dryads are the spirits of the forest, each one is born when a tree is and doesn't reach maturity until the tree does. They are very long lived and seem almost important. They sport many subtle colors of skin tones and are one with the forest and its inhabitants. Humans are just the latest fad in Mother Earth's game, though they do seem awfully destructive. You feel the forest's pain and the plants tell you their stories. You get where you need to be and know how to stay out when it's not your problem.</p>

                        <h4>Talking To Myself</h4>
                        <p>You can always hear what the plants are talking about and you're particularly invested in local gossip, you must occasionally take the time to have good chats with plant life but sometimes find great info.</p>

                    <p><strong>Playing a Pan:</strong> As a Pan you are a never aging child of wonder, you reign over your own pocket dimension created by your dreams. Though you cannot directly influence them, these lands slowly change depending on your dreams, coming up with new exciting things to do. Flying, dancing, acrobatics, climbing, whatever it is, you always excel but you won't ever stop to look at it from another's "perspective".</p>

Pistols? Karate? Maybe some exotic weapon? You can choose to roll Athletics instead of Physique for defensive rolls.</p>
