                <h2>👤 Playing a Mortal</h2>
                <p>Who are you? You are nobody. All you've ever wanted was a normal life with a little excitement, then monsters start showing up and turn your world on its head. Like, how is any of this happening? Well you gotta do what you gotta do and some things aren't better left unsaid. Time to figure out how to get what you want in life and learn what the supernatural actually is.</p>
                
                <p>As a Mortal, you're the anchor to reality in this supernatural world. You have no innate magical powers, no ancient lineage, no supernatural abilities. What you do have is humanity, adaptability, and the unique perspective of someone who wasn't born into this madness. You're the audience surrogate, the everyman who reminds supernatural beings what it means to be human.</p>

            <div class="darkest-self">
                <h3>🌑 Darkest Self</h3>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Nobody understands you. Nobody even tries. You do so much for the people you love, and they walk all over you. Enough is enough! Betray them. Show them what it's like to be uncared for. Reveal their monstrosity and yours. Only seeing the pain that you're causing your loved ones will let you escape your Darkest Self.</p>

                <div class="move-card">
                    <h4>Human Problems</h4>
                    <p>-x- You have problems like anyone else. When you draw supernatural characters into your mundane problems, you can choose to take automatic 7's instead of rolling for the rest of the scene.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4>Flesh And Blood</h4>
                    <p>-x- You can choose to refuse to roll to defend against a physical attack and allow yourself to take a Consequence to show others how fragile you are, effectively guilt-tripping them. For the rest of the scene, any overlapping damage you take is halved. (rounded up)</p>

                    <h4>Down The Rabbit Hole</h4>
                    <p>When you go poking your nose in affairs not meant for your kind and potentially dangerous to your health, the first time that a PC involved in the situation notices you and protects you, you both gain a Fate point.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>💕 The Smitten</h3>
                    <p><strong>Playing a Smitten:</strong> None of them would understand. What you have here, in this dark and secret place, it's beautiful. They'd warn you that this sort of beauty is dangerous, like a raging fire. Well some things are worth getting burned for. Love has eclipsed all hope, and the dark has left you feeling beautiful. What does it matter what they are? Love is Love! The heart wants what it wants. But love is often fleeting.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Moves only for Smitten:</h4>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>True Love</h4>
                        <p>Being alone is truly lonely sometimes, but maybe if you had someone? You could fix them, make them perfect. When you choose someone as your "true love" you get +2 on any rolls to help them but auto fail any Will rolls against them. Choose one character to be your 'true love'. They don't necessarily need to even acknowledge it. (Their player must agree though.)</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Downward Spiral</h4>
                        <p>When you think about your life or self too hard, letting the darkness in, you may cause yourself harm, gain an appropriate minor injury (bleeding, bruised etc). If you do, add +2 to your first roll in the next scene.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>The first time in a scene that someone special overlooks you, choose: Make a fuss about it and they receive a Fate point if they acknowledge it. Try to ignore your feelings and take a Fate point yourself instead.</p>

                    <p><strong>Playing a Neighbour:</strong> You're just trying to live your life, but the supernatural keeps knocking on your door. You're the one who notices when strange things happen next door, who hears the weird noises at night, who sees things that don't add up. You're the neighborhood watch for the supernatural world.</p>

                        <p>The first time in a scene you forgive someone for causing you a minor injury, excusing their base nature; gain a Fate point and +2 to your next roll involving them.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Excuses Are My Armor</h4>
                        <p>The first time in a scene you make excuses to ignore some blatant problem, getting you into even more trouble soon, you gain a Fate point.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Home Life</h4>
                        <p>The first time a non human PC sees how normal your life is, you gain +1 to Provoke or Rapport Rolls towards them in this scene and they choose 1: -they gain the social Aspect 'dangerous', -you gain the social Aspect 'delicious',</p>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Playing a Sighted:</strong> I hear people talk about monsters like they aren't real? How could they not be real? They're everywhere but most people can't see or refuse to see them. No point in mentioning it anymore, people think it's a prank. But why can I see them and why don't they seem to see me?</p>
