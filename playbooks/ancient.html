                <h2>🏛️ Playing an Ancient</h2>
                <p>History is everything, and you've seen your fair share, heard your fair share. You know what people are like, always willing to do anything for a buck. Humans have no loyalty to anything.</p>
                
                <p>As an Ancient, you carry the weight of millennia on your shoulders. You have watched empires rise and fall, seen the birth and death of countless mortals, and accumulated wisdom and power that younger beings can only dream of. Your perspective is shaped by the long view of history - you understand patterns, cycles, and the fundamental nature of power that others miss. Whether you're a hoarding dragon, a preserved mummy, or a scheming serpentine, you represent the ancient world's enduring legacy in the modern Dark City. Your challenge is navigating a world that has forgotten the old ways while dealing with beings who barely comprehend the depth of your experience.</p>

                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you are out of stress and consequences) you can become your Darkest Self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. You have been patient for longer than some civilizations have existed, and now your patience is exhausted. No more planning, no more manipulating, no more waiting. You know what you want, so take it. You escape your Darkest Self when you commit an act so inhuman that you scare yourself.</p>
