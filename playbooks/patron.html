                <p>You do everything for them, but you keep track. Bait the trap and wait like the patient spider. They'll never realize just how much they depend on you until it's too late, they have no idea what you can do.</p>
                
                <p>As a Patron, you understand that true power comes not from direct action, but from influence, manipulation, and the careful cultivation of dependencies. Whether you inspire greatness, grant wishes, or make deals, you always ensure that others owe you something. Your relationships are investments, and every favor you grant is a deposit in the bank of future leverage. You see the strings that connect people and know exactly how to pull them. In a world of supernatural beings with immense power, your strength lies in making them need you more than they need their own abilities.</p>

Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your stress and consequence caps. You've spent too long worrying about what they want. Call in every debt, and make sure they all remember exactly how little they'd have without you. Escape your Darkest Self when you get called out by someone who owes you a lot less than you owe them.</p>
