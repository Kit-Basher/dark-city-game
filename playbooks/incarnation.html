                <p>Death isn't always the end, sometimes it's just the beginning. Of course dying isn't a pleasant experience either. You remember everything but become something totally new.</p>
                
                <p>As an Incarnation, you exist between worlds - neither fully alive nor completely gone. You carry the memories and experiences of your past life while navigating the strange new reality of your current form. Whether you're a being in transition, an animated skeleton, or a lingering spirit, you understand mortality in ways others can only imagine. This unique perspective grants you insights and abilities that transcend normal human limitations, but also comes with the burden of unfinished business and the weight of what you've lost.</p>

Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. You're tired of life as it is. What's the point of it all? There's no reason for anything! Make them see the unrelenting misery and futility of their lives. You escape your Darkest Self when loved ones risk their lives for yours.</p>
