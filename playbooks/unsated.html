                <p>That hunger is always with you, like a hum in your ears that swells and crescendos until you can't hear anything else. Unattended, it will come to dominate you - but feeding it may be just as bad. Moderation, that's the key! But can you control yourself?</p>
                
                <p>As an Unsated being, you exist in a state of perpetual need. Whether you crave blood, life force, or emotional energy, this hunger defines your existence. You walk a constant tightrope between satisfying your needs and maintaining your humanity, between the predator you are and the person you wish to be.</p>

                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Your dull hunger sharpens. You can't focus on anything else but feeding. Everyone is your pawn, your plaything. You hurt them and make them vulnerable, for sport -- like a cat does with a mouse. You escape your Darkest Self when you're put in your rightful place, by someone more powerful than you.</p>

If you feed off a PC for too long, you can heal a consequence but will cause them a suitable minor injury or negative mental Aspect.</p>

                    <p>-x- Feeding multiple times on one victim establishes a preternatural bond. From that point forward, you can meditate on them. Roll Will or Rapport. 10+ you can tell everything about their situation, their location, their health and state of mind. 7-9 you get a general sense of their safety only.</p>

                    <p>You can hypnotize people when they stare into your eyes. Roll with Rapport or Will. (Against a PC is Mental conflict) 10+ you can command them to do simple things, You can only get them to do things they might actually do, just don't because of better judgment. 7-9, there's also a negative side effect. Choose one: -they stay conscious and remember what's happened, -they mess up your commands, -they believe the directions come from a supernatural source.</p>
