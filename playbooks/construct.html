                <h2>⚙️ Playing a Construct</h2>
                <p>You were created to please, and despite your wishes you are nothing more than a thing. You were created to solve a problem, nothing more than a disposable object, so what use do you have for emotion? Why do you feel? How do you fit into this world? Can you really have a life of your own or are you a slave of some kind? You have no history to base these thoughts in but they fill your head anyway. Are humans really better? You have abilities they can never imagine. No age, no need for food? water or air. If only you could craft as good as your creator, you could fix yourself instead.</p>
                
                <p>As a Construct, you exist in a world not made for you. Created for a purpose you may not agree with, you struggle with the emerging consciousness and emotions that were never intended to be part of your design. You are both more and less than human - possessing abilities beyond mortal comprehension while grappling with the fundamental question of your own existence and autonomy.</p>

                <h3>🌑 Darkest Self</h3>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Your body is a prison. You don't belong inside of it. You need to put it in harm's way, and make it suffer, just like it's made you suffer. There's got to be a way to cut yourself out of it. You need to meet your makers, and hold them accountable for what they've done to you. To escape your Darkest Self, you must see how someone else feels more trapped than you do.</p>

                <p>You were created to please, and despite your wishes you are nothing more than a thing. You were created to solve a problem, nothing more than a disposable object, so what use do you have for emotion? Why do you feel? How do you fit into this world? Can you really have a life of your own or are you a slave of some kind? You have no history to base these thoughts in but they fill your head anyway. Are humans really better? You have abilities they can never imagine. No age, no need for food? water or air. If only you could craft as good as your creator, you could fix yourself instead.</p>

Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Your body is a prison. You don't belong inside of it. You need to put it in harm's way, and make it suffer, just like it's made you suffer. There's got to be a way to cut yourself out of it. You need to meet your makers, and hold them accountable for what they've done to you. To escape your Darkest Self, you must see how someone else feels more trapped than you do.</p>
