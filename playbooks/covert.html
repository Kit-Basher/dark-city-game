                <p>You have always been apart, separate, watching from the shadows, but that may not be enough. How will you go about trying to fit into normal human society when your old life was so alien to them?</p>
                
                <p>As a Covert being, you exist in the spaces between - neither fully human nor entirely other. Your true nature is hidden behind layers of deception and mimicry, allowing you to move through the world unnoticed. Whether you're a trickster, a shapeshifter, or something else entirely, you have mastered the art of being unseen, unheard, and unknown until the moment you choose to reveal yourself.</p>

Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Your Darkest Self is a naked black skinned constantly morphing form fueled on the terror of others. You lash out at everyone who is in your path but especially those who are Haunted. You escape your Darkest Self when someone foolishly opposes you, despite being terrified - or you are treated like a person.</p>
