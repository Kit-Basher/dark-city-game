                <p>As an Aware being, you perceive the hidden truths and supernatural forces that shape the world around you. Where others see only the mundane, you see the connections, the energies, the destinies that bind all living things. This gift is both a blessing and a curse, for knowledge brings power but also terrible responsibility.</p>

Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Everyone is lying to you, all the time. If they will not accept your help, you must force it on them, expose the truth. There is no hope, no judgment, no reward, only oblivion to come. You escape your Darkest Self when you learn something shocking that you can't explain at all, or when someone reveals something to you that they'd prefer to keep secret, of their own free will.</p>
