                <h2>Playing a Construct</h2>
                <p>You were created to please, and despite your wishes you are nothing more than a thing. You were created to solve a problem, nothing more than a disposable object, so what use do you have for emotion? Why do you feel? How do you fit into this world? Can you really have a life of your own or are you a slave of some kind? You have no history to base these thoughts in but they fill your head anyway. Are humans really better? You have abilities they can never imagine. No age, no need for food? water or air. If only you could craft as good as your creator, you could fix yourself instead.</p>

                <h2>Darkest Self</h2>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Your body is a prison. You don't belong inside of it. You need to put it in harm's way, and make it suffer, just like it's made you suffer. There's got to be a way to cut yourself out of it. You need to meet your makers, and hold them accountable for what they've done to you. To escape your Darkest Self, you must see how someone else feels more trapped than you do.</p>

                    <p>When you defy your conceived role and adjectives, roll Will: 10+ remove an adjective you've outgrown and remove any minor harm (injury's) you have. 7-9 remove an adjective you've outgrown and add the adjective "decided".</p>

                    <p>You don't naturally heal but you can go to a skilled craftsperson for care. By spending a full detailed scene in a safe environment, they can either repair any of your physical adjectives or repair one of your physical consequences.</p>

                    <p>You know what you are and what you're not, you don't need people pointing it out to you. When people treat you like you are less than they are and you make a fuss about it, take +1 to all rolls to prove yourself, this scene.</p>

                    <p>When you extensively meditate on your existence roll +Will 10+ or higher will grant you views of what you must become, allowing you to permanently swap two of your stats. 7-9 gives confusing views of your conflicting adjectives.</p>
