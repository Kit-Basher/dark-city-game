                <h2>Playing an Aquatic</h2>
                <p>All Aquatics are at home in the water, you live very different lives than the drylanders. They think so differently than you do but something about them keeps you here living amongst them, what is it?</p>

                <h2>Darkest Self</h2>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. Everything sucks and you'll never change it, so just stop trying. Grab the person you care about the most and retreat to a safe place. Defend your little nest against all intruders and ignore everything else - it's not like you were making a difference anyway. You can only return from your Darkest Self when someone shows you that you've changed things for the better.</p>

                    <h3>Frog Kiss</h3>
                    <p>You are a creature of the deep and even in your human form you can easily breathe underwater and withstand the pressures of deeper waters. When you kiss someone while you are both underwater, roll Empathy or Rapport. 7+ they can breathe normally for as long as they stay close by. 6 or less they have to resurface immediately.</p>

                    <p>You have claimed a nearby location as your territory. When you are alone in your territory and completely safe, heal all minor injuries and negative adjectives. If someone invades your territory, give yourself the adjective 'Angry'. While Angry, take +1 on any rolls to attempt to remove intruders.</p>
