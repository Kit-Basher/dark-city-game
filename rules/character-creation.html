                    <h3>🎨 Reflavouring</h3>
                    <p>You're allowed and encouraged to <strong>re-flavour</strong> whatever you like when it comes to creating your character. This allows you to substitute almost any details, although remember that everything must stay mechanically the same.</p>
                    <p><em>Ex. for a werewolf your character could turn into a bear instead of a wolf, but they have to be some kind of were-animal.</em> Your character only has the abilities conferred by their physical form and their moves, so you can only do the things that you have moves for or just the physical ability to do.</p>

                        <p>Playbooks are basically character classes, each one has a general theme or feeling. Take a quick look at the playbook names and choose a couple that really jump out at you to look into.</p>
                        <p>Inside of each playbook are 4 sections:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Main</strong> - Information and moves available to any characters of that playbook</li>
                            <li><strong>3 Subtypes</strong> - Different specializations (choose only one)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Your character does not have to be the kind of creature described in the playbook, you may choose to be whatever you wish, though you only get the abilities that your moves give you.</p>

                        <p>Make sure to add any important relationships they already have as connections, people that they could potentially have as NPCs in their story. You can get extra connections by checking out the city and its inhabitants, before you start and/or while you play.</p>

                        <li>One skill at <strong>+4</strong></li>

                <h3>🎭 Character Aspects</h3>
                <p>Remember to add 2 Aspects to your character sheet. Try to get the essence of the character but not the super obvious. Just because they are a Huge guy or a Sexy lady doesn't mean you need "huge" or "sexy" as Aspects.</p>
