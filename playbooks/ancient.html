                <p>History is everything, and you've seen your fair share, heard your fair share. You know what people are like, always willing to do anything for a buck. Humans have no loyalty to anything.</p>

                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you are out of stress and consequences) you can become your darkest self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. You have been patient for longer than some civilizations have existed, and now your patience is exhausted. No more planning, no more manipulating, no more waiting. You know what you want, so take it. You escape your Darkest Self when you commit an act so inhuman that you scare yourself.</p>

                    <p>When you stare at someone without blinking, roll Provoke; 10+, they freeze up and will answer any basic queries until you leave or someone touches them, and afterwards they won't really remember anything unusual. 7-9, it'll still work, but only if you add another distraction. After they'll definitely know something weird happened.</p>
