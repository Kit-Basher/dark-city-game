                <h2>🔮 Playing a Mage</h2>
                <p>The energy is all around us, why can't they feel it? You can, it's part of who you are and you can use it, really it's too bad for those who can't, they don't know what real power looks like. They couldn't handle it if they did. Control the power, bend it to your will and make the world as you like.</p>
                
                <p>As a Mage, you perceive the fundamental forces that others take for granted. Magic flows through you like blood through veins, and you've learned to harness this power to reshape reality itself. Whether through years of study, natural talent, or dark bargains, you command abilities that defy explanation and break the laws of nature.</p>

                <h3>🌑 Darkest Self</h3>
                <p>As a last resort to being taken out, (when you're out of consequences) you can become your Darkest Self. Lose yourself in your monstrous urges and temporarily double your consequence caps. The time for subtlety and patience is over. You're too powerful to put up with their garbage any longer. Do whatever you need to do to get everything you want to have, so that life can be good again, like it used to be. You are no longer your darkest self when someone forces you to stop for a second and deal with your shit.</p>

                <p><strong>Choose three from this playbook and/or a subtype below:</strong></p>
                
                <div class="move-card">
                    <h4>Grimoire</h4>
                    <p>-x- You keep your knowledge in a book of spells and practices, each time you take this move, add 2 moves from the advancements to your grimoire. You can cast a spell from your grimoire for 1 FP plus the move's original cost, if it has any.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="move-card">
                    <h4>Focus</h4>
                    <p>You have a kind of object that you use to focus your energy and magic. With it in hand, gain +1 when trying to cast a spell.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="move-card">
                    <h4>Sanctuary</h4>
                    <p>You have a small special, secret place you maintain for practicing. The entrance is magically hidden and trapped to intruders. Take +1 to all rolls you make within this space.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="move-card">
                    <h4>Familiar</h4>
                    <p>You have a small magical pet or a small pet with magic, allowing them to appear or disappear at will. They are fully sentient and can communicate with you via telepathy. They can do anything their form infers but are no stronger.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="subtype-section">
                <h3 class="subtype-header">📖 Subtypes</h3>
                <p><strong>This is a subtype. Subtypes are mutually exclusive. You can choose a subtype without picking a move. When listing your playbook on your character sheet, list the subtype, if chosen.</strong></p>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>🎓 The Wizard</h3>
                    <p><strong>Playing a Wizard:</strong> Noble, wild, arrogant, and insecure. Wizards rule over a world that most people overlook or take for granted on a daily basis. They have raw power but their place in the world is shifting, maybe even vanishing.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Moves only for Wizards:</h4>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Magic Scroll</h4>
                        <p>-x- You can write a spell on vellum, able to be used by anyone. Any moves you combine on the same scroll must be applicable to the same purpose and/or situation. Inscribing a scroll takes a day per move and you must pay any original move activation costs. Casting the spell from the scroll costs 1 FP per inscribed move and destroys the scroll in the process.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Extra Hands</h4>
                        <p>You may spend a Fate Point and roll Will to give life to an inanimate object, (things bigger than a man can't walk around). 10+ your creation acts as an npc for the rest of the scene and listens to you 7-9 it does what you say but in doing so it causes you a new problem.</p>

                </div>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>🌙 The Witch</h3>
                    <p><strong>Playing a Witch:</strong> Intuitive, connected, and wild. Witches draw their power from the natural world, from cycles and seasons, from the earth itself. Your magic is less about rigid formulas and more about instinct and connection to the world's rhythms.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Moves only for Witches:</h4>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Natural Connection</h4>
                        <p>-x- When drawing power from natural elements (earth, fire, water, air, plants), take +1 on your magical rolls. You can also communicate with animals and sense disturbances in nature.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Coven Magic</h4>
                        <p>When working with other magical beings, you can combine your power. Each additional magical participant adds +1 to your combined magical rolls.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>🔥 The Warlock</h3>
                    <p><strong>Playing a Warlock:</strong> Ambitious, dangerous, and compromised. Warlocks gained their power through bargains with entities beyond mortal comprehension. Your magic comes at a price, and your patron always expects payment in the end.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Moves only for Warlocks:</h4>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Patron's Gift</h4>
                        <p>-x- You can call upon your patron for aid. Spend a Fate Point and roll Will: 10+ your patron grants you significant power for one task. 7-9 they help but demand a favor. 6- they help but the cost is higher than expected.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="move-card">
                        <h4>Binding Contract</h4>
                        <p>You can make magical contracts with others. When someone breaks a contract with you, you automatically gain +2 on rolls against them and they take a consequence of your choice.</p>
